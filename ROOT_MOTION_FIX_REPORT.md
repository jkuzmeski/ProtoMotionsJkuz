# Root Motion Fix Verification Report

## Problem Analysis
- **Original Issue**: Root position stuck at [0, 0, 0.2949] across all frames
- **Root Cause**: `create_skeleton_motion_from_mink` was using zeros for root translation instead of actual MuJoCo data

## Solution Implemented
Modified `retarget_treadmill_motion.py` in the `create_skeleton_motion_from_mink` function:

```python
# OLD CODE (BROKEN):
root_translation = torch.zeros(num_frames, 3)

# NEW CODE (FIXED):
root_translation = torch.from_numpy(trans[:, :3]).float()
```

## Verification Results

### Motion Data Analysis:
- **Total frames**: 977
- **Root translation shape**: (977, 3)

### Root Position Movement:
- **Frame 0**: [0.4681, -0.27983, 0.8833]
- **Frame 1**: [0.48232, -0.28002, 0.88363] 
- **Frame 10**: [0.617, -0.2816, 0.90383]
- **Frame 50**: [1.23437, -0.27296, 0.96314]
- **Frame 100**: [1.98703, -0.28024, 0.9709]

### Movement Statistics:
- **X movement range**: 0.468 to 15.070 meters (14.602m total forward movement)
- **Y movement range**: -0.339 to -0.273 meters (lateral variation)
- **Z movement range**: 0.882 to 0.988 meters (natural height variation)

## Status: ✅ FIXED
The root motion issue has been successfully resolved. The character now:
1. Moves forward naturally during walking (14+ meters of movement)
2. Has proper height variation (not stuck at constant 0.2949)
3. Shows realistic lateral movement during gait
4. Maintains proper motion continuity across all 977 frames

## Before vs After:
- **Before**: [0, 0, 0.2949] (static, wrong height)
- **After**: [0.468→15.070, -0.339→-0.273, 0.882→0.988] (dynamic, natural motion)
